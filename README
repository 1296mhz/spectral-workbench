Spectral Workbench is a web application built on Ruby on Rails and using the Fred graphics library for JavaScript. It allows you to upload images you've taken of spectra (using a prism or diffraction grating) and generate graphs for analysis. By Jeffrey Warren (http://unterbahn.com)

=============================================================

You can see it in action at: http://spectrometer.publiclaboratory.org

This project started in the Environmental Justice research cluster at RISD's Digital+Media department, run by Sara Wylie and Jeff Warren. It is now part of the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science's civic science toolkit.

TO DO:

* need a way to completely stabilize the camera to the spectrometer so people can just upload pairs which are already lined up
* maybe offer a "sample" spectrum with marked absorbtion lines, color transitions, which you line up your spectrum with?
* boundary or wavelength identification should be automatic, but is quite primitive - we need a way to identify a slope with parameters like "over 20 pixels, an average slope of x, with smoothness y, or at least continuously positive slope. Then we can say: "has_slope(red,start,end,slope,smoothness)"
* more advanced version of the above where we an auto-identify dips and peaks, and/or patterns of them - like the HO bands in infrared, to calibrate the image.
* need thumbnails of the actual spectrum, not the whole image
* need to start storing wavelength/intensity pairs which belong_to spectrums
* need comments and a better page layout - comments ought to be able to reference wavelengths with a @445 notation, maybe by doubleclicking on a wavelength?

Architectural:

* clean up functions in /app/views/spectrums/show.html.erb and move them into a spectral-workbench.js file and a Spork namespace
