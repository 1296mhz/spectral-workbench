Spectrofred is a web application built on Ruby on Rails and using the Fred graphics library for JavaScript. It allows you to upload images you've taken of spectra (using a prism or diffraction grating) and generate graphs for analysis a la reflectance spectroscopy. By Jeffrey Warren (http://unterbahn.com)
