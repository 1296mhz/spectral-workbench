==========================

Spectral Workbench is a set of open-source tools to perform low-cost spectral analysis and to share those results online. The suite is provided in several folders, each corresponding to a separate tool:

/webserver - A Ruby on Rails web application for publishing, archiving, discussing, and analyzing spectra online.
	- running at http://spectralworkbench.org; the primary way to use Spectral Workbench
/ios - A PhoneGap-based native iOS app currently under development in the 'ios' branch
/spectrometry_kit - A (deprecated) Processing.org-based desktop environment for collecting spectral readings from a connected USB webcam-based spectrometer.

INSTALLATION
==========================

These instructions are for the webapp in /webserver/ only:

The app requires Ruby 1.8.7 and Rails 2.3.15.

Thanks to YvesAD, there is a rough but detailed installation guide here: https://gist.github.com/YvesAD/5520784

However, instead of individually installing gems with "sudo gem install blablabla", you should be able to run "rake gems:install". 

This was based on his work in the Github issue here: https://github.com/jywarren/spectral-workbench/issues/206

Installation is not very straightforward, but we hope to improve it soon.
