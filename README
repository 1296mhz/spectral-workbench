Spectrofred is a web application built on Ruby on Rails and using the Fred graphics library for JavaScript. It allows you to upload images you've taken of spectra (using a prism or diffraction grating) and generate graphs for analysis a la reflectance spectroscopy.

You can see it in action at: http://spectrofred.unterbahn.com

There will be a better URL soon; this is a project of the Environmental Justice research cluster at RISD's Digital+Media department, run by Sara Wylie and Jeff Warren
