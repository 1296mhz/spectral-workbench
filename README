FRED:

Simple, stripped down JavaScript layered drawing environment with multitouch events, with an eye towards tablet web/vector authoring.

To contribute, please fork the project in Github: https://github.com/jywarren/fred, Then send pull requests! 

You'll have to edit the files in <fred root>/src/, then run 'rake build' from the Fred root directory and it'll compile everything in the /src/ directory into /fred.js, stripping out comments as it goes. This helps maintain ordering of the source loading, and also helps with minification.

You can also just create new tools in /tools/, adding them to Fred.tools, just as the pen tool is: Fred.tools.pen

Tools 'take over' mouse events and must have:

- <tool>.select() and <tool>.deselect() methods which are called when the tool is selected with Fred.select_tool('pen')
	- the deselect() method is called when you switch to a different tool, and must unsubscribe the tools listeners
- <tool>.draw() method which is called every frame
- <tool>.description, a string which describes the tool (used in tooltips and menus)
